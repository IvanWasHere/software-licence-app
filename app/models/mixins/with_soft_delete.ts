 * Soft deletion.
 *
 * Deleting a row a customer can see is never destructive: a lapsed card, a
 * mis-clicked delete or a departing colleague must not destroy shared work
 * (D9, plan §5.6). Rows are stamped with `deleted_at` and disappear from the
 * application's queries; the purge job is what eventually removes them.
 *
 * The mixin deliberately does *not* make deleted rows invisible globally.
 * A global query scope that silently rewrites every query is the kind of
 * magic that hides bugs — instead `notDeleted()` is explicit, and the admin
 * panel, which must see deleted rows, simply does not call it.
