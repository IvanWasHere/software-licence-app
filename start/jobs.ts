/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Background jobs
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Every job the worker knows how to run, and which cron tick dispatches the
| recurring ones (plan §9).
|
| `app/queue/registry.ts` owns the lookup and the schedule filter; it does not
| know what jobs exist. Registering here means `node ace queue:work` and
| `node ace schedule:run` both read one list, and a feature's jobs leave with
| the feature (docs/modules.md).
|
| A job with no schedule is dispatched by application code rather than by
| cron — `send_mail` when something is sent, `process_webhook` when one
| arrives.
|
| Renaming a `handler.name` strands the rows already queued under the old
| name, so treat those as permanent even while moving registrations around.
|
| **Removing a feature means deleting its block here.**
