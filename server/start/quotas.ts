|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Quota registry
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Every quota this application enforces, in the order the meter grids render
| them (plan §7.3, §7.4).
|
| A quota is a limit from `config/plans.ts` plus how to count what is using
| it and what to label its meter. How a limit is *named* in a `402` lives
| beside the limit itself, in `LIMIT_NOUNS`. `PlanService` owns the arithmetic — the amber-at-80% rule, the `>=`
| that makes a downgraded workspace read as full, the row lock inside a
| create — and knows nothing about what is being counted. This file is where
| the two meet.
|
| An explicit file rather than each feature registering itself on import, for
| the reason `app/queue/registry.ts` is one: a quota that silently stopped
| being registered would be a limit that silently stopped being enforced, and
| the first person to notice would be a customer on the wrong side of it.
|
| **Removing a feature means deleting its lines here** — see
| `docs/modules.md`. Nothing else needs to change: the meter grids, the
| at-cap banner and the API's usage payload all iterate what is registered.

/**
 * `apiKeys` and `apiCallsPerMonth` are deliberately absent.

 * Both are enforced against `config/plans.ts` and both render a meter, but
 * their numbers come from `ApiKeyService` and the usage rollup rather than
 * from a count over a tenant-owned table, and neither belongs on the grid
 * that every screen shows. They go through `PlanService.describeCount`
 * instead, which is the same arithmetic without the registration.
