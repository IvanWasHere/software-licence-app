|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The organisation API's surface

|
| Every scope a key can hold and every endpoint the published spec describes
| (plan §11).
|
| Both are registered rather than listed in `app/`, because the endpoints
| they describe belong to features. `app/api/scopes.ts` owns what a scope
| *is* and how one is checked; `app/api/openapi.ts` owns the document's shape
| and the shared fragments; neither knows what this application actually
| serves.
|
| Scope order is the order they are offered on the key-creation form, listed
| in the spec, and stored on a key. It means nothing to enforcement, but a
| stable order is what makes two keys' stored JSON comparable.
|
| **Removing a feature means deleting its block here** — see
| `docs/modules.md`. The form, the spec, `/docs`, the key validator and the
| scope check all read the registry, so nothing else changes.
