|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Rate limits on the authentication surface
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Every unauthenticated POST in this application is a place where somebody
| else's password, one-time code or invitation token can be guessed, or where
| our mail reputation can be spent on somebody who never asked for the email.
| The organisation API has had limits since M6 (§11); these are the same idea
| pointed at the front door (M8).
|
| Four rules, deliberately layered rather than merged into one:
|
| - **By address** — the blunt one. Stops a single host hammering the whole
|   auth surface, whatever endpoint it picks.
| - **By address *and* account** — the sharp one. A password guesser works
|   through candidates for one address, so counting that pair is what actually
|   costs them, and it does so without letting anybody lock a stranger out of
|   their account by burning the limit from a different network.
| - **By account** — only where the cost is an *email* rather than a session
|   (password reset, verification resend). The thing being protected there is
|   somebody's inbox, so the address is the right key even though it means a
|   determined attacker can stop *themselves* being able to request one.
| - **By pending challenge** — a six-digit code is 10^6 wide, which is only
|   safe while guesses are slow.
|
| Two properties of the limiter that are easy to be surprised by, so they are
| stated here rather than discovered later:
|
| 1. It counts **requests, not failures**. A successful login spends a point
|    exactly like a wrong password does. Every window below is therefore sized
|    for a person having a bad morning behind an office NAT, not for the
|    theoretical minimum. If you want to count only failures, that means
|    consuming from the controller instead — see CONTRIBUTING.md.
| 2. Keys are hashed where they would otherwise be an email address. The
|    `rate_limits` table is operational data with no retention policy of its
|    own; there is no reason for it to accumulate a list of who tried to sign
|    in and when.
