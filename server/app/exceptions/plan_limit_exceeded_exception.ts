 * or a downgrade costs a customer nothing and re-upgrading needs no restore
 * job.
 *
 * A blocked create is never a dead end. Both renderings say which limit was
 * hit, what the ceiling is and where to raise it:
 *
 * - **API** — `402` with a machine-readable `limit` key, so a customer's
 *   integration can branch on it instead of retry-looping against a wall.
 * - **Web** — a flash carrying the same numbers, which the page turns into
 *   the inline `.plan-card` upsell.
