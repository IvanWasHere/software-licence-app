 * Recomputes every list's `todos_count` and reports drift (plan §5.5).

 * It **alerts rather than repairs**. The counter is only ever written inside
 * the same transaction as the insert or delete it accounts for, so drift can
 * only mean a bug — and a job that quietly fixes the number every night is a
 * job that hides that bug forever. The corrected value is written so the
 * product stays usable; the log line is the part that matters.
