/**
 * A list, as the API describes one (plan §11).
 *
 * Every field is named explicitly. That is the point of a transformer here:
 * adding a column to `todo_lists` must never widen the public contract by
 * accident, and an internal integer id must never leave the process — the
 * API addresses everything by `public_id` (D6).
 *
 * Keys are snake_case on the wire while the models are camelCase, so the
 * translation happens once, here, rather than in every client.
 *
 * Every timestamp goes out as `toUTC().toISO()` — i.e. `…Z`. A DateTime read
 * back from the database renders as `…+00:00` while one just created renders
 * as `…Z`, and an API that emits both formats for the same field makes a
 * client comparing strings break on a row's second read (CONTRIBUTING).
