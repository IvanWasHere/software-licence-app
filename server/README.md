## 🤔 What this is

A **kitchen-sink starter** for a subscription SaaS. Not a demo: the awkward parts — the ones that
usually get skipped and then bite in month three — are the parts that are actually built.

- 💳 A **failed payment doesn't lock anyone out**, and a downgrade never deletes anything.
- 🔒 Every tenant-owned query filters on `organization_id`, with a dedicated test suite that seeds
  two workspaces and asserts, endpoint by endpoint, that one can never touch the other.
- 🧮 Quotas are enforced **inside the insert transaction behind a row lock**, so two parallel
  requests can't both take the last slot — proven by concurrency tests on PostgreSQL.
- 🪝 Webhooks are idempotent, ordered by watermark, and replayable from a stored payload.
- 🕵️ Staff impersonation is time-boxed, read-only for support, and audited with **both** actor ids.

The demo domain is deliberately small — shared to-do lists — because it exists to exercise tenancy,
quotas and the API, not to be the product. Swap it for yours:
[`docs/modules.md`](./docs/modules.md) is the removal path, file by file.

📓 [`plan.md`](./plan.md) is the full design document and the source of truth for scope.
🛠️ [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) has the rules that keep it working — read it before
changing anything.

---

## 🚀 Quick start

You need **Node 24+**. Nothing else — SQLite needs no server.

```bash
# 1️⃣  Install
npm install

# 2️⃣  Configure
cp .env.example .env
node ace generate:key          # writes APP_KEY

# 3️⃣  Create the database and demo data
node ace migration:fresh --seed

# 4️⃣  Run it
npm run dev                    # 🌐 http://localhost:3333
node ace queue:work            # ⚙️  second terminal — nothing is emailed without it
```

### 🔑 Seeded accounts

Sign in with any of these. Staff and customers are **different tables behind different logins** —
a staff address is rejected at `/login` exactly as a stranger would be.

| Account | Password | Signs in at | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🛡️ `admin@example.com` | `Admin12345` | `/admin/login` | Staff — **admin** |
| 🎧 `support@example.com` | `Support12345` | `/admin/login` | Staff — **support** |
| 👑 `user-manager@example.com` | `Manager12345` | `/login` | Workspace **owner** |
| 👤 `user@example.com` | `User12345` | `/login` | Workspace **member** |

> 🔢 Staff two-factor is mandatory. In development enter **`123456`** (see `DEV_TWO_FACTOR_CODE`),
> or run `node ace dev:totp admin@example.com` for a real code.

Want a richer playground — paid plans, a team, lists and todos, API traffic, payment history?

```bash
node ace dev:seed              # 🏭 five workspaces, a team, lists, keys, files, payments
```

### 📬 Seeing the email

Everything goes through the queue, so run a worker. Locally the transport is
[Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org):

```bash
brew install mailpit && mailpit     # then open http://localhost:8025
```

### 🔍 The development toolbar

`npm run dev` puts a stats bar at the foot of every page — Node version, uptime, CPU, event-loop
lag, heap and RSS, requests per second, average latency, error rate, and the database pool. Click
the tool icon at its far left and it opens into a debug panel over the page:

| Panel | What is in it |
|---|---|
| 🗃️ **Queries** | Every SQL statement this request ran, with bindings, duration, and `EXPLAIN` on demand |
| 📡 **Events** | Application events and their payloads |
| ✉️ **Emails** | What was sent, to whom, and the rendered body — without leaving the page |
| 🧭 **Routes** | Every registered route and its handler |
| 📝 **Logs** | The log stream, filterable by level and correlated by request id |
| ⏱️ **Requests** | A trace per request — the waterfall of queries and events inside it |
| ⚙️ **Config / Internals** | Resolved configuration and the toolbar's own state |

There is also a full page at **`http://localhost:3333/__stats`** — the same data kept over time,
with charts, slowest endpoints, grouped query analysis and saved filters. Its history lives in a
SQLite file under `.adonisjs/server-stats/`, which is git-ignored.

Nothing to configure and nothing to start: it is wired up in `config/server_stats.ts` and appears
on its own.

> ⚠️ **There is no login on any of it.** The debug panel renders resolved environment variables,
> email bodies and SQL with its bindings to anyone who can reach the port.

That is deliberate, and it is safe for one reason only — **the toolbar cannot exist in a deployed
environment.** [`adonisjs-server-stats`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adonisjs-server-stats) is a
**devDependency**, the runtime image is built with `npm ci --omit=dev`, and every place that
registers it — the provider in `adonisrc.ts`, the middleware in `start/kernel.ts`, the config in
`config/server_stats.ts`, the Edge global in `start/view.ts` and the partial it includes from
`layouts/base.edge` — is guarded on one flag:

```ts
// start/dev_toolbar.ts
export const serverStatsEnabled =
  process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' &&
  process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test' &&
  isInstalled('adonisjs-server-stats')
```

Read that flag before changing it; each clause is load-bearing and two of them are not obvious.
`NODE_ENV` is compared against `production` rather than `development` because AdonisJS evaluates
`adonisrc.ts` **before** it loads `.env`, so at that moment `NODE_ENV` is `undefined` on a laptop —
the obvious spelling disables the toolbar for everyone and says nothing about why. `test` is
excluded separately because the suite installs dev dependencies but boots the application in the
`test` environment, where the provider does not load; without that clause the layout would include
a tag nothing had registered and Edge would print `@serverStats()` into the HTML that every
functional and browser test asserts against. The resolve check is what makes a deploy that forgets
to set `NODE_ENV` degrade to *off* rather than to a crash loop on a missing module.

`config/shield.ts` makes two concessions to it, both keyed on the same flag and both inert in
production:

- **CSP** — `script-src` trades the nonce for `'unsafe-inline'`. The toolbar inlines its own
  client, and a browser **ignores** `'unsafe-inline'` as soon as a nonce appears in the directive,
  so the two cannot simply be listed together. Deployed, the nonce policy is untouched.
- **CSRF** — the toolbar's own routes are exempt. Its dashboard mutates state from `fetch()` calls
  that carry no token; the package guards those handlers itself with a same-origin check.

The collector list in `config/server_stats.ts` is spelled out rather than left on `'auto'`, to drop
one collector that counts rows in three tables every three seconds — with `debug: app.inDev` on
both connections that is sixty lines of SQL a minute in your terminal on an idle server. The cost
is three tiles; the Queries panel is unaffected, because it reads `db:query` events rather than
that collector.

To remove the toolbar entirely: delete the guarded blocks in the five files above and in
`config/shield.ts`, delete `start/dev_toolbar.ts` and `partials/server_stats.edge`, then
`npm uninstall adonisjs-server-stats`. Uninstalling alone is not enough — the application still
*runs*, because every import is lazy and behind the flag, but `npm run typecheck` fails on four
modules it can no longer resolve.

## 🔧 Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. It arrives with every value filled in except one — **`APP_KEY` is
the only thing you have to generate.** Everything below it belongs to a feature you can leave
switched off.

### ✅ Required

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `APP_KEY` | 🔑 **The only blank in `.env.example`** — run `node ace generate:key`. Signs cookies and encrypts 2FA secrets, so **rotating it invalidates both** |
| `APP_URL` | 🌐 Pre-filled as `http://localhost:3333`. Used in emails and webhook return URLs, so it must be the real hostname in production |

### 🗄️ Database

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DB_CONNECTION` | `sqlite` | `sqlite` \| `postgres` |
| `DB_SQLITE_PATH` | `./tmp/db.sqlite3` | SQLite only |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | 🐘 Postgres; or use the discrete vars below |
| `DB_HOST` `DB_PORT` `DB_USER` `DB_PASSWORD` `DB_DATABASE` | — | Postgres, if not using `DATABASE_URL` |
| `DB_SSL` | — | `true` for most managed Postgres |

### 📧 Mail

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MAIL_MAILER` | `smtp` | `smtp` (Mailpit) locally, `resend` in production |
| `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | `onboarding@resend.dev` | ⚠️ Resend only sends from a **DNS-verified domain** — until then the sandbox sender reaches only your own address |
| `MAIL_FROM_NAME` | `Acme` | |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | — | Required when `MAIL_MAILER=resend` |
| `SMTP_HOST` `SMTP_PORT` | `localhost` `1025` | Mailpit |

### 💳 Payments — [Creem](https://creem.io)

Leave blank and the app runs on the Free plan; billing screens render and refuse to check out.

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `CREEM_API_KEY` | 🔐 Your secret key |
| `CREEM_API_URL` | `https://test-api.creem.io` — the **live** host is a deliberate, visible change |
| `CREEM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | 🪝 HMAC secret for `POST /webhooks/creem` |
| `CREEM_PRODUCT_PRO` / `CREEM_PRODUCT_BUSINESS` | Product ids, mapped back to plan keys |

> 🚇 For local webhooks: `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3333`, then
> `node ace billing:replay <id>` to re-run a stored payload with **no network at all**.

### 📁 Storage

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DRIVE_DISK` | `fs` | `fs` locally \| `r2` in production |
| `DRIVE_FS_ROOT` | `storage` | Where the local disks live |
| `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` `R2_BUCKET` | — | Cloudflare R2 |
| `R2_ENDPOINT` | — | `https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| `R2_PUBLIC_URL` | — | 🌍 Custom domain fronting the **public** disk (avatars, logos) |

### 🌐 Social login

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Blank hides the Google button |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | Blank hides the GitHub button |

### 🧰 Operations

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `LIMITER_STORE` | `database` | `database` \| `memory` (tests) |
| `QUEUE_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` | `5` | |
| `QUEUE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `1000` | |
| `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` | — | 🚧 Comma-separated. Gates all of `/admin` including its login. Empty disables it. A second layer, **never** the boundary |
| `SESSION_DRIVER` | `cookie` | |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | `false` | ⚠️ Believe `X-Forwarded-For`. On behind a proxy you control; off otherwise — it decides what every rate limit counts against and what the audit trail records |
| `CSP_REPORT_ONLY` | `false` | Report policy violations without blocking, while tightening a directive on a live site |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | |
| `DEV_TWO_FACTOR_CODE` | `123456` | ⚠️ Accepted in place of a real code, and **only** while `NODE_ENV=development`. Unset it anywhere that is not a laptop |

## 📸 Screenshots

Every one of these is the seeded demo data — `node ace db:seed && node ace dev:seed` — so what is
on the page is what you get after two commands, not a mock-up.

Start with the four account types. Note what each role **cannot** see: the nav is gated, so nobody
is offered a screen that would refuse them.

## 🚢 Deployment

Two processes, and the worker is not optional — every email, webhook and scheduled job goes through
the queue, so an application without a worker accepts work it will never do:

```bash
node ace migration:run --force   # release phase
node bin/server.js               # web
node ace queue:work              # worker
```

Or the whole stack, the way it runs deployed:

```bash
docker compose up --build
docker compose run --rm web node ace migration:run --force
```

📘 [`docs/deployment.md`](./docs/deployment.md) — the image, the processes, health checks, proxies,
backups, what to alert on, and a checklist for the first deploy.
🔐 [`docs/security.md`](./docs/security.md) — what this does about each of the OWASP Top 10, what it
deliberately does not, and what is left to whoever deploys it.

✅ CI runs lint, typecheck, the full suite against **both** SQLite and PostgreSQL, and a build of
the image on every push. A migration that only works on one engine fails the build.
