/**
 * What `script-src` has to become for the development toolbar
 * (`#start/dev_toolbar`) to run, and why it cannot be done by addition.
 *
 * The toolbar is deliberately self-contained: `@serverStats()` writes its
 * stylesheet and its client into the page as inline `<style>` and `<script>`
 * elements, and the dashboard at `/__stats` is served the same way. None of
 * those scripts carry the nonce, because the package has no way to know
 * about it — it takes no nonce option and never reads `cspNonce`.
 *
 * Adding `'unsafe-inline'` alongside `@nonce` would do nothing at all. A
 * browser that understands nonces **ignores** `'unsafe-inline'` as soon as a
 * nonce or hash source appears in the directive, which is the rule that
 * makes nonce policies worth having; the toolbar would still be blocked and
 * the only evidence would be a console message. So the nonce has to come out
 * for `'unsafe-inline'` to mean anything, and the two cannot be combined.
 *
 * Hashing the inline blocks instead was the other option and was rejected:
 * there are several of them, their content changes with every release of the
 * package, and a stale hash fails exactly like a policy error.
 *
 * This applies only where `serverStatsEnabled` is true, which is only where
 * the package is installed — never in a deployed environment, where the
 * nonce policy below is unchanged and is the one that matters.
